# TextEncryption

A simple **Java-based application** implementing classical cryptography techniques, including **Caesar Cipher** and **Rail-Fence Cipher**.  
This program demonstrates both **encryption** and **decryption**, with a user-friendly looping menu system.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**  
  - Encrypts and decrypts text using a shift value (1-25) 
  - Handles both uppercase letters and other characters

- **Rail-Fence Cipher**  
  - Encrypts and decrypts text using a custom key (number of rails)
  - Implements a zig-zag transposition 

- **Interactive Menu**  
  - Choose between ciphers and encryption/decryption options
  - Loops until the user chooses to exit.
